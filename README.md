# Building-smartcontracts-and-dapps-on-Solana-blockchain
This Solana tutorial goes through a step by step process of setting up a development environment for Solana, writing and deploying smart contracts and my experiences.


I settled on setting up a WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux) Ubuntu version so that I could write the code in Windows and then just use a linux command line to compile the Rust smart contract to a .so file.

If you don’t have WSL set up already it’s a great tool and there are detailed instructions and a download link here:
